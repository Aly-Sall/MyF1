        Ferrari | Arrival of Lewis Hamilton in 2025

        Hamilton's current contract with Mercedes was due to expire at the end
        of 2025 but he will depart the team after this season and replace Carlos
        Sainz at Ferrari. <br /> The British driver activated a release clause
        in his Mercedes contract, and Ferrari confirmed on Thursday evening that
        the seven-time world champion is joining them on a "multi-year" deal.
        The seven-time world champion is the most successful driver in F1
        history with 103 wins and 104 pole positions. Michael Schumacher is the
        only other driver with seven world titles. Hamilton, who has not won a
        race since December 2021, joined Mercedes in 2013 from McLaren and has
        won six world titles with the team. He was linked to Ferrari for this
        year but signed a new two-year contract last summer, along with Mercedes
        team-mate George Russell, to stay until the end of 2025. "Hamilton's 39
        years old now. This is maybe his last opportunity to drive for Ferrari.{" "}
        <br />
        He has previously talked about being happy to finish his career at
        Mercedes, with whom he has achieved so much. "He says his idol Ayrton
        Senna never drove for Ferrari, and therefore you can have an iconic
        career without driving for them. Hamilton has been linked to Ferrari
        several times since his F1 career started in 2007 with McLaren. He won
        his first world championship with McLaren in 2008 but left at the end of
        2012 to join Mercedes, where he has formed the most successful
        team-driver partnership in F1 history with 82 victories. However, since
        the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Hamilton has rarely fought
        at the front of the pack as Red Bull got on top of the new 2022
        regulations and Mercedes fell behind. He failed to win and take pole
        position for the first time in 2022 and continued his winless streak in
        2023.
